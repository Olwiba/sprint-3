 What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

 When you resize the demo page to less than 550px images on the page change to completely different pictures to improve the layout when on mobile devices. Also various other elements on the page such as the layout of grids containing text or images change to only display one item per row. This is done so when viewing on smaller devices it's content doesn't get so small you can no longer read it.

 This is done by media queries that have been specifically written deepening on the device screen size. It gives the browser a specific layout style according to the screen size, this enables the developer to make sure that the site displays correctly on all devices.
