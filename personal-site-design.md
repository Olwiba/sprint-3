What is you site's primary purpose?

As a place for me to share my work and experiences from the Dev academy and my journey to becoming a full stack web developer. 

Who is your target audience?

People who study web development such as my teachers and my peers studying at the Dev academy with me. 

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want the home page of the site to intrigue the visitor, make them want to continue clicking though to other pages. Using some of the features from my wish list i want to implement a simple navigation so its easy for users to get around my site. I also want to redesign the page structure so its more responsive giving the user a fluid feel to the site as well as optimizing the page on various devices.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

Creating a wire frame of my sites design should give me a good general idea on what elements are going to be needed on the page as well as where they are going to be positioned. Then using a framework i will be able to build a responsive skeleton to add all my content to. This will ensure responsiveness as well as guaranteeing that all of my elements are going to have a place on the screen.
